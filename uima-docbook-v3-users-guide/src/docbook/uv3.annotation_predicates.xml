<chapter id="uv3.annotation_relation_predicates">
  <title>Annotation relation predicates</title>

  <para>When working with annotatins, it is often necessary to express how two annotations related
  to each other. This happens for example when using the Select framework to say "select all
  annotations of type T that follow a given annotation X". So there are a number of possible
  relationships which two annotations can have with each other such as "following", "preceding",
  "being colocated", "being covered by", "covering", etc. This chapter provides specification of 
  these relationships which are also available as a set of predicate functions. The Select framework
  is also consistent with these definitions. In order to query the CAS for annotations that exist
  in a certain relationship to each other, it is possible to e.g. stream an entire annotation index
  or CAS and filtering the annotations using the provided predicate functions. However, using the
  corresponding selector functions of the Select framework is generally much faster than filtering
  using the predicates as Select knows more efficient way of finding the starting point for a
  particular query in the annotation index and also knows when a search can be aborted without
  having to scan an entire index and also without missing any matches. The predicates are 
  implemented as static functions in the <code>org.apache.uima.cas.text.AnnotationPredicates</code>
  class.
