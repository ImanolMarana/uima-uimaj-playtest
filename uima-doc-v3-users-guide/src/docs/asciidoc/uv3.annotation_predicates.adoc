= Annotation relation predicates

When working with annotations, it is often necessary to express how two annotations related to each other.
This happens for example when using the Select framework to say "select all annotations of type T that follow a given annotation X". So there are a number of possible relationships which two annotations can have with each other such as "following", "preceding", "being colocated", "being covered by", "covering", etc.
This chapter provides specification of  these relationships which are also available as a set of predicate functions.
The Select framework is also consistent with these definitions.
In order to query the CAS for annotations that exist in a certain relationship to each other, it is possible to e.g.
stream an entire annotation index or CAS and filtering the annotations using the provided predicate functions.
However, using the corresponding selector functions of the Select framework is generally much faster than filtering using the predicates as Select knows more efficient way of finding the starting point for a particular query in the annotation index and also knows when a search can be aborted without having to scan an entire index and also without missing any matches.
The predicates are  implemented as static functions in the `org.apache.uima.cas.text.AnnotationPredicates` class.
